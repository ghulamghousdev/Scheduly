## Concept
  The goal of the software application is to provide a possible timetable solution with the
  minimum number of clashes between slots. It relieves the user of much of the hard work
  required for generating timetable manually, leaving him with more time to apply the
  skills and judgment where they are needed in order to produce a timetable of the highest
  quality. 
  
## Scope of this Project
  The software which we are designing can be used by any faculty to generate a timetable in 
  future. This algorithm will satisfy all the hard constraints which are mentioned below:
  -   A Teacher should have only one class at a time.
  -   A student should have only one class at a Time.
  -   There should be no free period between the lectures for a class of students.
  -   Each class has a fixed number of lectures in a day.

## Algorithmic Approach Used
  The algorithmic approach which we are going to use in this project is **Heuristic Approach**. 
  All the hard constraints are dealt with by using **Constraint-based Programming**.
  
## Technologies Used
- MERN Stack
- Bootstrap
- React
- Redux
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express.js
